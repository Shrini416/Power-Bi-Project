Steps I Followed in My First Power BI Project:

Imported three text files and used tab as the delimiter.
Deleted unwanted columns, such as email and phone number.
The Name and Age fields were combined, so I split them into two separate columns.
Capitalized the first letter of the names.
Removed duplicates.
Imported an Excel file using a new query.
Renamed the file names.
Closed and applied the changes.
In the model view, I linked the two tables using the Name column.
Started visualizing the data using bar charts, pie charts, etc.
Used formatting options like changing colors, using the format painter, adding data labels, values, titles, font color, etc.
Grouped data based on whether a certificate was issued ("Yes" or "No").
Exported the dashboard.
